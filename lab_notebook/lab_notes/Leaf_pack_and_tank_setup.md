# Crayfish leaf decomposition experiment set up

## Metadata

File created on 8 June 2016 by KF

## Description 

Leaf packs were created to measure leaf mass loss in the presence of invasive (_O. virilis_) or native (_Cambarus sp. C_) crayfish. 

The experimental design is a target neighbor design in NUMBER VOLUME tanks

The tanks were set up... NEED TANK SET UP DETAILS

### Treatment Assignments

|      | native | high | equal | low | invasive |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Ov   | 0      | 6    | 4     | 2   | 4        |
| CspC | 4      | 4    | 4     | 4   | 4        |

the numbers indicate the abundance of each species in each tank

## 1 June 2016 Leaf Pack Prep

Senescent tulip poplar leaves (collected Fall 2013) were weighed into 1.5 g leaf packs on the field balance. We were able to get 115 leaf packs before we ran out of suitable leaves.

The leaf packs were then softened in DI water for 5 minutes and then bound with a size 2 binder clip (19 mm, 3/4 in). Sets of 20 bound leaf packs were then placed into about 18 L of DI water to leach before adding to the tanks.

## 3 June 2016 Add Leaf Packs to Tanks

Tanks were chosen from a random number table and a leaf pack was chosen haphazardly from the buckets and gently added to the tank, taking care to distribute the packs relatively evenly in the tanks. This was repeated until all the tanks had 3 leaf packs.

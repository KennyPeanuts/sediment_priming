## Description 

To determine the initial mass of the leaf packs in the experiment, 11 representative leaf packs (see [Leaf_pack_and_tank_setup](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/crayfish_leaf_decom)) were placed into randomly selected tanks and then immediately removed and placed into a pre-weighed paper bag.

The bags were then dried at 50 dC for 48 h

The bags + leaves were then re-weighed

The leaves in the bags were then "ground up" in a pestle by crinkling them by hand.

The ground leaf material was then added to a pre-weighed crucible and ashed at 550 dC for 5 h to determine AFDM

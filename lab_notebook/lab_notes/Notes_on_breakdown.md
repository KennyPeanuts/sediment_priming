## Description

This experiment is designed to evaluate the impact of the sediment environment on leaf litter decomposition. 

Senecent tulip poplar leaves were incubated in 250 ml jars, either in contact with sediments from LPP or on a shelf suspended above the sediments.

Details about the experimental set up can be found on files:

## Breakdown Procedure 

1) Gently siphon off the overlying water until the leaves on the shelf are exposed.

2) Remove 2 leaf disks from the shelf and store in MeOH in freezer for Ergosterol

3) Remove the remaining 8 leaf disks from the shelf and very gently rinse with DI on the seive.

4) Select the 1st three leaves on the sieve and Gently blot each leaf dry with a paper towel then measure toughness on the toughness meter

5) After toughness has been measured, dry the disks and grind for C/N

6) Dry the remaining 5 leaves in a pre-weighed crucuble for LOI

7) Remove the shelf and siphon off the remaining water

8) Repeat steps 2 - 6 on the sediment leaves

9) Rise the sediments through a 250 um - 153 um seive and preserve the retained material in 70% EtOH

## Breakdown Observations

#### Observations on the leaves and sediments

The water in the jars had a thin clear biofilm on the surface of the water that was present for most of the experiment

The leaves on the shelf, had a 1 - 2 mm "cloud" of clear material around them, that appeared to be a microbial biofilm of some sort that was fluffed up when it was wet but collapsed when the water was drained.

The leaves on the shelf were mostly reddish brown to yellowish brown in color. None were black like are found in anoxic conditions. 

The leaves in the sediments were much darker and some that were partially buried did appear almost black.

The leaves on the shelf seemed to be either tough or not and I think this may have been an initial difference in the leaves that we chose. The "tough" leaves were very easy to manipulate with the forceps but the "thin" leaves tore easily.  

The sediment leaves were all very fragile.

There was evidence of burrowing animal activity in jars 2, 5, 9, & 10.  These jars had obvious galleries along the glass and mounds of sediment at the burrow openings.  The mounds of sediment partially or completely buried the leaves on the sediment surface.

The surface sediments were orange and light tan. This coloration extended about 2 - 4 mm into the sediments The deeper sediments were medium gray

The sediments directly under the leaf discs were the light tan color suggesting that the sediments were oxygenated even under the leaves.

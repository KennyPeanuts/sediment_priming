## Description

This experiment is designed to evaluate the impact of the sediment environment on leaf litter decomposition. 

Senecent tulip poplar leaves were incubated in 250 ml jars, either in contact with sediments from LPP or on a shelf suspended above the sediments.

Details about the experimental set up can be found on files:

## Breakdown Procedure 

1) Gently siphon off the overlying water until the leaves on the shelf are exposed.

2) Remove 2 leaf disks ifrom the shelf and store in MeOH in freezer for Ergosterol

3) Remove the remaining 8 leaf disks from the shelf and very gently rinse with DI on the seive.

4) Gently blot each leaf dry with a Kimwipe for 5 seconds then measure toughness on the toughness meter

5) After toughness has been measured, dry 2 disks and grind for C/N

6) Dry the remaining 6 leaves in a pre-weighed crucuble for LOI

7) Remove the shelf and siphon off the remaining water

8) Repeat steps 2 - 6 on the sediment leaves

9) Rise the sediments through a 250 um - 153 um - 63 um seive and preserve the retained material in 70% EtOH

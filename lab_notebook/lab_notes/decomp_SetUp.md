## Field Sediment and Water Collection

### 29 Jan 2016

On 29 Jan 2016 we collected sediments and water from LPP. The lake was frozen and so we slid a raft onto the ice and chopped 2 holes through the ice that were approximately 20 m from the shore toward the middle of the lake. We then took 3 ekman samples from
each hole, taking care not to hit the same spot in the sediments. The ekman samples from each hole were combined into a single basin, so there were 2 basins each with 3 ekman samples in them. The water was about 1 m deep where the ekmans were taken

Back on shore the sediments were passed through 250 um mesh nets to exclude CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

We collected 9 L of water from another hole about 10 m toward the middle of the lake from the ekman holes.  The water from this hole came out clear, so it did not appear that the ekman sampling affected the water collection. The water was about 1.5 m deep where the water was collected and the YSI run.

A YSI sample was collected from another hole adjacent to where the water was collected.

| Parameter |  0 m  | 0.5 m | 1 m   |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----  |
| Temp (dC) | 4.69  | 4.73  | 4.95  |
| Cond (uS) | 12.99 | 12.91 | 12.79 |
| perc DO   | 66.7  | 70.4  | 76.1  |
| DO (mg/L) | 8.17  | 8.66  | 9.32  |


### 4 Feb 2016

Water (6 L) was collected from LPP using the dip-collector and stored in the dark at room temperature. The pond at the time of collection was full of runoff from recent rain and the water was rather turbid with some suspended particulates.

### 10 Feb 2016

Water (10 L) was collected from LPP using the dip-collector and placed in the refrigerator

## Lab Procedures

### 3 Feb 2016

Using a ladle the sediment slurry in the buckets was thoroughly mixed and then ladled into a graduated cylinder to add 100 ml of slurry to each septum-top jar.  The septum top jars are wide-mouth glass jars that are 13 cm tall and 5 cm id at the base. The jars hold approximately 250 ml.

The jars were then filled to the top with the lake water collected on 29 Jan 2016.

The jars the placed on the dark and allowed to settle.

The jars were labeled 1 - 10 with red or yellow tape but the colors no longer mean anything in the current design.

### 2 Feb 2016

The overlying water in all of the jars was replaced with the lake water collected on 29 Jan 2016. The water was sucked off with a syringe down to within a few mm of the sediment-water interface and then water was very carefully added back so as not to disturb the sediments.

| Jar Number | Water Vol Removed (ml) | Water Vol Replaced (ml) |
| ---------  | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1          | 180                    | 205                     |
| 5          | 180                    | 190                     |
| 2          | 175                    | 205                     |
| 6          | 180                    | 205                     |
| 8          | 185                    | 200                     |
| 7          | 185                    | 190                     |
| 4          | 175                    | 195                     |
| 3          | 180                    | 200                     |
| 9          | 175                    | 185                     |

The overlying water in the jar was partially changed again. A flexible plastic tube was curved into an upward "U" about 2 cm tall with a long tail of tube on one end. The "U" was inserted into the jar with the base of the "U" just above the sediments. The tube was then filled with water with a syringe to create a siphon and 250 ml of lake water (collected on 4 Feb 2016) was siphoned into the jar allowing the excess water to overflow.

To prepare the leaves for the experiment about 10 L of DI water was added to a bucket and then 35 senescent tulip poplar leaves, collected during the Fall 2013 and stored air dried were added to the water.  The bucket was covered with black plastic and the leaves were allowed to leach.

#### Punching Leaf Discs

Leaf discs were punched from the leached litter using a number-7 cork borer to produce a 13 mm disc. Large veins and the midrib were avoided. 355 discs were cut and placed in a beaker of DI water in the fridge to ensure that they would sink when added to the jars. 

### 12 Feb 2016
#### Begin Incubation

First we added 10 leaf discs to each jar so that they would rest on the sediment. The leaves were added to all jars simultaneously so that they were selected haphazardly. All of the leaves sank immediately to the bottom of the jar.

At the same time that the discs were added to the jars, we added 10 leaf discs to each of 9 pre-weighed crucibles for LOI and 5 leaf discs to each of 5 weigh boats for C:N.

We then inserted 4 cm tall wire shelves made from hardware cloth into the sediment at the bottom of the jars. We were careful to avoid the leaves on the sediments but the shelf legs pushed a leaf disc into the sediments in jar red 4 and jars red and yellow 3.

After all the shelves were inserted we carefully added 10 leaf discs to the shelf.  Some of the discs fell over the side of the shelf but in most cases these could be recovered with the forceps. Jar red 10 had a disc fall between the glass and the leg in a way that it could not be recovered, so there are only 9 discs on the shelf and one disc wedged between the shelf and the wall of the jar near the sediments.

The bottles were then carefully filled to the 250 ml mark with lake water collected on 10 Feb 2016 (stored in fridge).

The bottles are incubated in the dark at room temperature (approximately 22 dC).

Please consider our manuscript "Evidence for positive priming of leaf litter decomposition by contact with eutrophic pond sediments" for publication in Hydrobiologia. Our paper shows that the loss of leaf litter toughness and C content is accelerated  when the leaves are incubated in contact with the sediments of a small eutrophic pond. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for positive priming of leaf litter decomposition by sediments. There is increasing interest in priming effects in freshwater systems and priming has been shown for dissolved organic carbon pools and for leaf litter exposed to living algae but the role of priming in organic matter cycling in freshwaters remains poorly described. Our study contributes to the growing understanding of priming effects in freshwaters by providing evidence that eutrophic sediments could alter the way that allochthonous inputs are processed in small lentic systems. Given the abundance of small ponds and the importance of allochthonous subsidies in freshwater ecosystems, our results could apply across a wide variety of freshwater systems.

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication and we look forward to your feedback.
